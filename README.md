# ☀️ Weather Outfit Advisor
I made this project because I often find it difficult waking up in the morning and wearing the wrong outfits. Like wearing a sweater and then realizing it's actually hot outside. Or wearing light clothing and stepping out into cold wind and cloudy skies. So I thought — you know what, let me make something that just tells me what to wear.

##  About
Weather Outfit Advisor is a simple, personal weather app that shows:

- The current temperature in Celsius
- A short weather summary (like "overcast clouds")
- A friendly outfit suggestion, written like someone giving you useful advice
- The current location and date
The app automatically detects your location (if permission is given) and uses real-time weather data to provide personalized outfit recommendations. No more guessing if you need a jacket or if shorts are appropriate today.

## ✨ Features
- Location Detection : Automatically finds your location or falls back to IP-based location
- Real-Time Weather : Shows current conditions using OpenWeatherMap API
- Time-Based Forecasts : Check what to wear later today (5PM and 6PM options)
- Smart Outfit Suggestions : Recommendations based on temperature, precipitation, and wind
- Clean Interface : Minimal design focused on what you need to know
- Responsive : Works on mobile and desktop devices

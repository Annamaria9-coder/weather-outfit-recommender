# 👕 Weather Outfit Advisor

I made this project because I often find it difficult waking up in the morning and wearing the wrong outfit. Like wearing a sweater and then realizing it’s actually hot outside. Or wearing light clothing and stepping out into cold wind and cloudy skies. So I thought — you know what, let me make something that just tells me what to wear.

- 📍 Auto-detected location and date
- ☁️ Clean, friendly UI — no graphs, no confusing charts, just what you need
